#Baili Wilkinson Aisle Rocket Challenge

 To Run:
- Clone repository on github.
- Run npm install within the project via terminal.
- Run npm start to launch the project.

Commnents:

- This was a fun challenge to complete! I have a bit of a perfectionist nature to it was great to harness that where I could. 

- The image quality is lacking in the fully responsive example. In a work environment I would get with the design team to acquire a higher quality image that would work well responsively.
